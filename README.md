# Analytics-Framework
Personal analytics framework by PrivateGER.
Full DB intergration using PDO, so the database system is easily interchangeable.
Captures hashed IP, country, countrycode, time, originating page and wheter the user is located in the EU. 
All this data can be used in either a custom dashboard or in the included one.

Most data is collected clientside, which means you won't have to buy any sort of premium access for the GeoIP service.
